# RNN_TV_Script_Generation
Using LSTMs to generate new TV scripts with PyTorch.

## Project Overview
This project is part of the requirements for the completion of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. It consists of training a recurrent neural network in this case LSTMs to generate scripts in the style of dialogue from Seinfeld using PyTorch.
