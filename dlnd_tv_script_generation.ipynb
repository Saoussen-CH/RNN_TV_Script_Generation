        "I tried different  combination of hyperparamters from sequence lenght of [16, 32, 64] with hidden_dim of 512 and n_layers = [1, 2] . The combination presented in this notebook seems to converge faster. For the hidden_dim and n_layers, I followed the recommendations given in the courses on sentiment_analysis with RNN, SkipGram ect, where they recommend to keep the n_layers between 1 and 2 (two being the most recommended), Also I received a warning when using n_layer = 1 saying that the dropout should be desactivated if n_layer = 1. I also made sure to choose batch sizes that are power of 2 as binary systems tend to work well with it for faster computation. Also I followed the recommened embedding_dim = 256, and varied learning_rate between 0.01 and 0.001. After much experimentation, I choose to submit the training results with this combination of hyperparameters. "
